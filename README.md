# Cas-protein-sliding-distance-simulation
This collection is a Python code for Monte Carlo simulation.

The code was utilized to determine the optimal sliding distance of Cas9 along the DNA strand, enabling efficient and rapid localization of the target site in the shortest amount of time.

To run the simulation, you need to copy the code and run it into Python version 3.7. 

Refer to the methods section for the demo parameters.
